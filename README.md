# Introduction

This code is a Python program for a GUI-based chatbot that uses OpenAI's ChatCompletion API to generate responses. The chatbot model used is gpt-3.5-turbo, which is a highly advanced model developed by OpenAI.

The program has a clear history feature that allows the user to clear the chat log and start a new conversation. The conversation history is stored in a list called message_log, which contains a series of dictionaries representing the messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot.

The program creates a queue to communicate between the GUI and the background thread. The background thread handles incoming messages and sends them to the chatbot, and then receives the chatbot's response and sends it back to the GUI. The GUI consists of a text field for the user to input messages and a chat log that displays the conversation history.

## Goal
The goal of the program is to provide a conversational AI assistant that can understand and respond to natural language input from the user. The program uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to input messages and view the conversation history. The chatbot model used in this program is "gpt-3.5-turbo", which is a variant of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model optimized for chatbot use cases. The program also includes typing animations to simulate a more natural conversation flow.

This is a traditional ChatGPT using GPT 3.5 Turbo. Feel free to customize.
